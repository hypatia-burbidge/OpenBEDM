is found it imposeth upon men s thoughts that doth bring lies in favor but a natural though corrupt love of the lie itself one of the later school of the grecians examineth the matter and is at a stand to think what should be in it that men should  ... 
world half so stately and daintily as candle lights truth may perhaps come to the price of a pearl that showeth best by day but it will not rise to the price of a diamond or carbuncle that showeth best in varied lights a mixture of a lie doth ever  ...

was otherwise inferior to the rest saith yet excellently well it is a pleasure to stand upon the shore and to see ships tossed upon the sea a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below but no pleasure  ... 
not with swelling or pride certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a man s mind move in charity rest in providence and turn upon the poles of truth to pass from theological and philosophical truth to the truth of civil business it will be acknowledged even by those  ... 
goings of the serpent which goeth basely upon the belly and not upon the feet there is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to be found false and perfidious and therefore montaigne saith prettily when he inquired the reason why the word of the lie  ... 
the wickedness of falsehood and breach of faith cannot possibly be so highly expressed as in that it shall be the last peal to call the judgments of god upon the generations of men it being foretold that when christ cometh he shall not find faith upon the earth

<title>Of Unity</title>

<body>
in religion religion being the chief band of human society it is a happy thing when itself is well contained within the true band of unity the quarrels and divisions  ... 
but the true god hath this attribute that he is a jealous god and therefore his worship and religion will endure no mixture nor partner we shall therefore speak a few words concerning the unity of the church what are the fruits thereof what the bounds and what the means  ... 
scandals yea more than corruption of manners for as in the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humor so in the spiritual so that nothing doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church as breach  ... 
men s ears nolite exire go not out the doctor of the gentiles the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care of those without saith if an heathen come in and hear you speak with several tongues will he not say that you are mad and  ... 
so serious a matter but yet it expresseth well the deformity there is a master of scoffing that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library sets down this title of a book the morris dance of heretics for indeed every sect of them hath a diverse posture or  ... 
peace of conscience and it turneth the labors of writing and reading of controversies into treaties of mortification and devotion concerning the bounds of unity the true placing of them importeth exceedingly there appear to be two extremes for to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious is it  ... 
make an arbitrament between god and man both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of christians penned by our savior himself were in two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded he that is not with us is against us and again he  ... 
already but if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally of this i may give only this advice according to my small model men ought to take heed of rending god s church by two kinds of controversies the one is when the matter of the  ... 
varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity the other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an over great subtilty and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious than substantial a man that is of  ... 
think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita  ... 
peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colors will agree in the dark the other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of nebuchadnezzar  ... 
and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion but we may not take up the third sword which is mahomet s sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary persecutions to force consciences except it be  ... 
is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum what  ... 
is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring  ... 
the holy ghost instead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and set out of the bark of a christian church a flag of a bark of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes  ... 
the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds they ever fly by twilight certainly they are to be repressed or at least well guarded for they cloud  ... 
natures as in the example of henry the seventh of england there was not a more suspicious man nor a more stout and in such a composition they do small hurt for commonly they are not admitted but with examination whether they be likely or no but in fearful natures  ... 
are saints do they not think they will have their own ends and be truer to themselves than to them therefore there is no better way to moderate suspicions than to account upon such suspicions as true and yet to bridle them as false for so far a man ought  ... 
whisperings of others have stings certainly the best mean to clear the way in this same wood of suspicions is frankly to communicate them with the party that he suspects for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the truth of them than he did before and withal  ... 
faith but it ought rather to kindle it to discharge itself

others have made suspicious and cunning propositions of banks discovery of men s estates and other inventions but few have spoken of usury usefully it is good to set before us the incommodities and commodities of usury that the good may be either weighed out or culled out and warily  ... 
part be employed upon merchandizing which is the vena porta of wealth in a state the second that it makes poor merchants for as a farmer cannot husband his ground so well if he sit at a great rent so the merchant cannot drive his trade so well if he  ...
