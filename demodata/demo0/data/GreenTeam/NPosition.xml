 ... 
about religion were evils unknown to the heathen the reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief for you may imagine what kind of faith theirs was when the chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets  ... 
the fruits of unity next unto the well pleasing of god which is all in all are two the one towards those that are without the church the other towards those that are within for the former it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest  ... 
of unity and therefore whensoever it cometh to that pass that one saith ecce in deserto another saith ecce in penetralibus that is when some men seek christ in the conventicles of heretics and others in an outward face of a church that voice had need continually to sound in  ... 
certainly it is little better when atheists and profane persons do hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion it doth avert them from the church and maketh them to sit down in the chair of the scorners it is but a light thing to be vouched in  ... 
cringe by themselves which cannot but move derision in worldlings and depraved politics who are apt to contemn holy things as for the fruit towards those that are within it is peace which containeth infinite blessings it establisheth faith it kindleth charity the outward peace of the church distilleth into  ... 
peace jehu what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me peace is not the matter but following and party contrariwise certain laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle way and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would  ... 
that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention this is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done  ... 
point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife about it kindled only by contradiction for as it is noted by one of the fathers christ s coat indeed had no seam but the church s vesture was of divers colors whereupon he saith in veste  ... 
judgment and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself that those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgment which is between man and man shall we not  ... 
profanas vocum novitates et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern the term the term in effect governeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the  ...

in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorize conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the people s hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this  ... 
would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it  ... 
him in saying i will descend and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murthering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down  ... 
by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of the same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of

lame men the same is the case of men that rise after calamities and misfortunes for they are as men fallen out with the times and think other men s harms a redemption of their own sufferings they that desire to excel in too many matters out of levity and  ... 
near kinsfolks and fellows in office and those that have been bred together are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised for it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes and pointeth at them and cometh oftener into their remembrance and incurreth likewise more into the note  ... 
more or less subject to envy first persons of eminent virtue when they are advanced are less envied for their fortune seemeth but due unto them and no man envieth the payment of a debt but rewards and liberality rather again envy is ever joined with the comparing of a  ...

 ... 
for nobility attempers sovereignty and draws the eyes of the people somewhat aside from the line royal but for democracies they need it not and they are commonly more quiet and less subject to sedition than where there are stirps of nobles for men s eyes are upon the business  ... 
the low countries in their government excel for where there is an equality the consultations are more indifferent and the payments and tributes more cheerful a great and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch but diminisheth power and putteth life and spirit into the people but presseth their fortune  ... 
state for it is a surcharge of expense and besides it being of necessity that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune it maketh a kind of disproportion between honor and means as for nobility in particular persons it is a reverend thing to see  ... 
the act of time those that are first raised to nobility are commonly more virtuous but less innocent than their descendants for there is rarely any rising but by a commixture of good and evil arts but it is reason the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity and  ... 
the passive envy from others towards them because they are in possession of honor certainly kings that have able men of their nobility shall find ease in employing them and a better slide into their business for people naturally bend to them as born in some sort to command

but it spoileth the plantation for they will ever live like rogues and not fall to work but be lazy and do mischief and spend victuals and be quickly weary and then certify over to their country to the discredit of the plantation the people wherewith you plant ought to  ... 
make use of them then consider what victual or esculent things there are which grow speedily and within the year as parsnips carrots turnips onions radish artichokes of hierusalem maize and the like for wheat barley and oats they ask too much labor but with pease and beans you may  ... 
in the beginning till bread may be had for beasts or birds take chiefly such as are least subject to diseases and multiply fastest as swine goats cocks hens turkeys geese house doves and the like the victual in plantations ought to be expended almost as in a besieged town  ...

some special cause of caution cram not in people by sending too fast company after company but rather harken how they waste and send supplies proportionably but so as the number may live well in the plantation and not by surcharge be in penury it hath been a great endangering  ... 
they have good store of salt with them that they may use it in their victuals when it shall be necessary if you plant where savages are do not only entertain them with trifles and gingles but use them justly and graciously with sufficient guard nevertheless and do not win  ... 
then it is time to plant with women as well as with men that the plantation may spread into generations and not be ever pieced from without it is the sinfullest thing in the world to forsake or destitute a plantation once in forwardness for besides the dishonor it is

which is the worst property in a servant of a prince or state therefore it is good for princes if they use ambitious men to handle it so as they be still progressive and not retrograde which because it cannot be without inconvenience it is good not to use such  ... 
they are of necessity good commanders in the wars must be taken be they never so ambitious for the use of their service dispenseth with the rest and to take a soldier without ambition is to pull off his spurs there is also great use of ambitious men in being  ...

against ambitious great ones for when the way of pleasuring and displeasuring lieth by the favorite it is impossible any other should be overgreat another means to curb them is to balance them by others as proud as they but then there must be some middle counsellors to keep things  ... 
well but if they be stout and daring it may precipitate their designs and prove dangerous as for the pulling of them down if the affairs require it and that it may not be done with safety suddenly the only way is the interchange continually of favors and disgraces whereby  ...

these intentions in another that aspireth is a wise prince generally let princes and states choose such ministers as are more sensible of duty than of using and such as love business rather upon conscience than upon bravery and let them discern a busy nature from a willing mind

in men nature is often hidden sometimes overcome seldom extinguished force maketh nature more violent in the return doctrine and discourse maketh nature less importune but custom only doth alter and subdue nature he that seeketh victory over his nature let him not set himself  ... 
him practise with disadvantages as dancers do with thick shoes for it breeds great perfection if the practice be harder than the use where nature is mighty and therefore the victory hard the degrees had need be first to stay and arrest nature in time like to him that would  ... 
himself at once that is the best optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus vincula qui rupit dedoluitque semel neither is the ancient rule amiss to bend nature as a wand to a contrary extreme whereby to set it right understanding it where the contrary extreme is no vice let not  ... 
both and there is no means to help this but by seasonable intermissions but let not a man trust his victory over his nature too far for nature will lay buried a great time and yet revive upon the occasion or temptation like as it was with aesop s damsel  ... 
best perceived in privateness for there is no affectation in passion for that putteth a man out of his precepts and in a new case or experiment for there custom leaveth him they are happy men whose natures sort with their vocations otherwise they may say multum incola fuit anima  ... 
so as the spaces of other business or studies will suffice a man s nature runs either to herbs or weeds therefore let him seasonably water the one and destroy the other
