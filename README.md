# Purpose
> Software for Collaborative Use of Information Buried Behind Security Defenses

OpenBEDM is an open source software project that aims to develop and deploy code and infrastructure for Blind Encrypted Data Matching or BEDM. 

The goal is not a new application; rather, the goal is to modify existing applications to preserve privacy and data security while enabling cooperation over shared mutual interests. The project is aligned with the evolution of cooperation as understood in political science. Successful implementation and deployment would facilitate safe and 
effective applications of sensitive or private data.

# Two Parts

## Code
There is code in Java divided into packages that form an API to functions that add BEDM functionality to existing applications. OpenBEDM is not in any sense an application. 
It is a way that people with large systems that contain sensitive data cooperate safely using the API.
The current release on this GitHub repository contains a simple demonstration application demo0P.java. There is a video that
illustrates the simple demonstration in action. [See it here](https://openbedm.org/H/mov/WalkthroughDemo0.html) 

The code is actually easy. It is provided mainly to have a rallying point for the API and interface descriptions. But, then it gets tough. At this point, the project has
not selected and implemented a particular method for network communication. Moreover, the field in general is impeded by data silos and administrative barriers. These 
remain in place. No magic and yet there is potential in BEDM. 

## Multiple-Author, Open Source, Book

Feedback about the technical process of BEDM has been almost universally positive. However, it isn't used. InTel-Q and IBM threw a lot of money into a related ideas with a 
few flaws and even that effort is little used. So, it is necessary to go back to the beginning. What are the components and politics of a data processing enterprise?
The answer has escaped the project thus far. To find it, the search has moved into book form. The book is open source and extensible. Hopefully, contributors to OpenBEDM will add their wisdom.
