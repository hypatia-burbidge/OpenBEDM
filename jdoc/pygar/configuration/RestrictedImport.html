<div class="block">The use of modules annotated with @RestrictedImport should be limited 
 because these modules have an ability to access security
 sensitive files and databases. They should only be imported into tested and 
 approved applications. Note, this documentation also contains a general 
 discussion of the security philosophy behind the security zones and
 the various annotations such as @RestrictedImport. Please see below.
 
 <p><em>Summary of Restrictions</em></p>
 <ul>
 <li>The private key of the local entity should only be used to sign
 outgoing documents and to decrypt documents sent to this entity.
 <li>The public key of other entities should only be used to encrypt
 documents sent to that outside entity and conversely to verify the
 signature of documents sent by the outside entity.
 </ul> 
 
 <p><em>Prevention of Malware Intrusion with Careful Software Design</em></p>
 <p>There is absolutely no way to prevent the intrusion of malware - viruses, worms, 
 spyware, etc. - with software alone. Physical security is of paramount importance 
 followed by network firewall defenses. In addition, security managers must contend with
 the danger that an insider tries to
 install unauthorized software to compromise security. Proper software design can
 make it easier to defend against such an insider threat. 
 </p><p>
 Our philosophy is that the core software should be simple, clear, and readily verifiable
 by inspection. Next we combine that decision with annotations that flag modules that should
 only be used with verified modules. For example, modules that access keystores should be run
 only by verified, core software. Just by preventing access to keystores, we can prevent the
 forgery of documents, for example. The integrity of this system can be checked by verifying 
 that the sensitive modules are imported only by modules that were verified and approved
 to use the sensitive module.
 </p><p>
 In addition, the software is divided into zones. There is no automatic way to use the zones
 to any advantage. However, any organization that is very conscious of security can arrange 
 an architecture of computers that allocates the software zones on different processors and 
 separates them with internal firewalls. When that approach is taken, legitimate work of the
 system is performed efficiently without impediment but malware that finds it way into one
 zone or another is unable to obtain information or communicate with its outside controllers. 
 </p>
 <p><em>Status of the Implementation of Zones</em></p>
 <p>Although specific zones were implemented as named packages in early versions of the software, various
 practical and theoretical problems lead to the abandonment of the first design. The most
 obvious problem is that some modules are needed in two zones - so how do we assign them to
 two packages? The solution will involve separating the packages into zoned software when the 
 releases for each zone are built. This new solution has not yet been implemented although
 we have identified the modules that are involved in zoning by assigning them to the 
 package "zoneable". In the absence of a finished zone system in this release, we are
 keeping the documentation for the first design of zones as an example of one type of
 zone architecture.
 </p>
 <p><em>The Old Zone System Design - for illustration only</em></p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Zone 10</b>: this is the innermost, most protected zone. A client of the system
 keeps the secret data in Zone 10 and composes the documents here. Any new document is 
 partially encrypted with the session key before leaving the zone. On the other hand, 
 software in this zone cannot communicate with the world directly and it cannot use keys
 or certificates to encrypt or sign messages. In the match-maker, Zone 10 contains the 
 actual match-maker process. The match-maker has no session keys so the data entering
 this zone is partially encrypted and remains so. Data leaving is formed from encrypted
 data and is thus also encrypted.
 <li><b>Zone 6</b>: In Zone 6 incoming data is decrypted using the private key of the 
 current system entity. Thus, any data that was not intended for this entity is rejected.
 More importantly, very few components have access to to private key, thus, it is difficult
 for malware to read data documents intended for this entity. Outgoing data in Zone 6 is
 encrypted with the public key of the intended destination to ensure that only the 
 destination entity reads the data. Note that this encryption even protects against 
 malware operating in Zones 3 and 0.
 <li><b>Zone 3</b>:In Zone 3, the signature of incoming data is verified with the public key
 of the source entity. If the signature is not verified, the data is rejected. Also in this
 zone, this entity signs all outgoing documents using its private key. 
 <li><b>Zone 0</b>:In Zone 0, both incoming and outgoing documents have three layers of encryption
 established by the inner zones. Thus, this zone has the lowest security requirement. However,
 the zone must still be protected as well as possible from denial of service attacks and other
 outside attempts to damage the system.
 </ul>
 <p>The system has three types of keys: session keys, public keys associated with entities, and the 
 public/private key-pair of the local entity used by the public-key-encryption system . 
 If each keytype in its own keystore
 then we can restrict access to just those modules that have a legitimate reasons to use a key.
 For this reason there are three keystores: <ul>
 <li><b>public_keystore</b>: the storage for public keys for other entities and the public 
 certificate for this entity. This is used only in Zones 3 and 6. 
 <li><b>private_keystore</b>: the storage for the private key of this entity. This is used only in Zones 3 and 6.
 <li><b>session_keystore</b>: the storage for sessions. Note, this is used only in Zone 10
 with a client and never in the match-maker. 
  </ul>
  Note that we can restrict the session_keystore to Zone 10, but the other two stores are needed in 
  both Zone 3 and 6 because of the different inbound and outbound processing. Nevertheless, no legitimate
  operation in this system requires more than one keystore to accomplish its function. 
  Any module that imports two
  keystores is suspect and should not be trusted.</div>
