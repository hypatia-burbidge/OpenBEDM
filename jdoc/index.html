<div class="block"><p>OpenBEDM is an open source software project that aims to develop and deploy code and infrastructure
for <em>Blind Encrypted Data Matching</em> or <B>BEDM</B> It is derived from an ealier OSS project. 
hosted on SourceForge and known as Pygar. <a target="blank" href="./whoIsPygar.html">See here for an explanation of the name Pygar. </a>

<p>  <a name="desc"><B>Description</B></a> </p>
<p>
<em>Blind Encrypted Data Matching</em> is a new method for negotiating an
agreement when both sides are hiding all their information. The
negotiation is conducted by a blind broker who is unable to read the
hidden information. In the end, the two parties reach an agreement on
a contract or the sharing of secret data without revealing any
unnecessary information from their positions of secrecy. The broker is
kept in the dark throughout.
</p><p>
BEDM is useful in situations were the parties are at great risk. They
can't trust each other and they can't trust a third party
negotiator. BEDM uses a middleman, but the middleman never sees
anything that isn't encrypted. Nevertheless, the middleman/broker can
identify links between encrypted statements that are made by the
various parties. If there are linked statements, the parties know that
they have an opportunity for a mutually-beneficial, highly limited,
cooperative transaction. The parties can pursue that opportunity
without revealing any information beyond the matching statements found during the
encrypted data-matching operation. The middleman never learns what is involved.

<p>  <a name="package"><B>Remarks on the Software Packages</B></a> </p>
<p>
The Pygar software system comprises applications for a  match-maker service that
offers <em>Blind Encrypted Data Matching</em> or <B>BEDM</B> as well as
applications for the clients of that service. The client applications
help a client prepare encrypted data
for matching, designate their match partners, and participate in matching
sessions with the BEDM match-maker service. All applications are stored in
packages in the software source directory. </p>
<p>Software that is shared between applications is also stored in
packages and these packages are organized by software function.</p>
<p>Finally, any secure installation of this software must divide the
software into security zones. The zones are created at the
installation site by physical separation of computers, network
firewalls, and other standard provisions. The Pygar software system
designates packages by software zones but that by itself is merely
installation information - not an assurance of security.
To be secure, the software must be 
segregated by security zone when it is installed. For example, the client software to
encrypt sensitive information is located in the most secure zone and
widely separated from the client software that transfers encrypted
documents to external sites. Packages that communicate over the
internet should not be installed in the most secure layer and the
designation of the packages by zone facilitates the implementation of
this rule.</p>
<p>All of the packages are documented in the hypertext document that
you are reading now with ancillary explanation referenced here by
URL. The primary programming language for the project is Java. </p>

 <p>  <a name="zones"><B>Design Features for Security </B></a> </p>
 <p>Please see the discussion on the subject
   pygar.configuration.RestrictedImport RestrictedImport 
<p>This section provides comments that apply to all the security zone packages and attempt to clarify how they are used together.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Security Zones</b> Currently, the Zones are not stated anywhere explicitly. Instead,
  any modules that should be restricted to particular zones are indicated by including them the package named "zoneable". They may also be indicated by the annotation "Restricted Import". This aspect
  of the code remains under continued development to make it more explicit and consistent. Expect neither attribute 
  in this early release. 
   <li><b>Flow of Data Documents</b>
   <ul>
  <li>The software within the zones observes the convention that incoming data is pulled towards the more secure zone by a component running in the more secure zone. This conforms to the intuitive notion that the user accounts that run the software components have different priviledges and that the user account for a less secure zone should not be able to directly read or write data to a more secure zone.  
  <li>When information flows out of the system, a component in the more secure zone pushes it towards the less secure zone. Note that this particular component is highly-suspect. It must be fully verified and certified to ensure that it cannot accidently release unencrypted data.
     </ul>
     <li><b>Cloud Computing</b><ul>
       <li>Additional features may be needed to secure the middleman's server if it uses cloud
       computing implementations. These features are not included or described in this release.
      
       </li> </ul>
